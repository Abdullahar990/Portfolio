## ðŸ‘‹ About Me  
Hello! Iâ€™m Muhammad Abdullah, a passionate computer science student currently enrolled in FASTâ€™s BSCS 5G batch (roll 22L-6836). I have experience across web development, automation, AI/ML, and software engineering. Iâ€™ve developed practical projects during internships and academic coursework, and I love applying what I learn to build things that make a difference.

### Highlights of my journey  
- Built an image-gallery using HTML, CSS & JavaScript as part of an internship at CodeAlpha.  
- At Mindbridge, I managed high-volume customer tickets for Uber Chat Support (Mar 2015 â€“ Sep 2017), handling refunds and investigations.  
- Worked as a telesales rep at Hightech Communications (Feb 2014 â€“ Jan 2015) and as a sales executive at The Resource Group (TV/Internet/Phone solutions) â€” gaining strong communication and pressure-management skills.  
- Currently engaged in AI & ML internship work, developing a variety of projects including a background-removal Streamlit app, a disease-prediction web app, a hotel-management system, and more.  
- My long-term goal: create intelligent mobile-centric applications (e.g., accident alerts via smartphone) and advance in fields like mobile edge computing, blockchain and wide-area network connectivity for cloud.
